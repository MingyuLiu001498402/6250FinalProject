## 1. Project Description
### Background

The Game of Life is actually a zero-player game, which includes a two-dimensional matrix, and each point in this matrix is an independent cell. Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors using the following four rules: firstly, any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population; Secondly, any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation; Thirdly, any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population; Finally, any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. As the game progresses, the disordered cells will gradually evolve into various delicate and tangible structures, and these structures often have good symmetry, and each generation changes shape.
